### As the money piled up, the baker found himself surrounded by agreeable people.

## Description

```
For others, rain makes for old, lonely lolz on windows se. From under neath, comes true, intellectual, omnipotent needs. 
â€¢
I'm sorry I ratted you out. In retrospect, what you did was amazing.
â€¢
#Nothing #good can #grow here anymore. Still, the ideas that exist, and by extension -- you, can find a way to communicate with the future.

### Line-One Code (Section 1)
When one examines line 1 of the description: "For others, rain makes for old, lonely lolz on windows se. From under neath, comes true, intellectual, omnipotent needs.", they will notice that the first letter of every word spells out `Form follows Function`.

### Interesting Detail
This is the first video to be age restricted, which is odd considering the ones before it were not.

Throughout the video, bits of text flash for single frames.

###What's Being Shown
The entire video seems to be a compilation of college age students having a wonderful time together, hanging out with each other, skateboarding, setting off fireworks, and generally being young adults. Throughout the video are sections of film and audio that are reversed, many of them being the fireworks they set off. At around 3:45 we see these fireworks are mostly homemade.
